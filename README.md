This github page will be maintained and attempt to keep parity with the jwm.place
minecraft server and is provided as an easy resource to download the collection of mods
used on the server. This server is a private entity whose members are invite-only, this page is meant only as a reference.

For versioning, each .jar file will indicate the proper version of the mod to download.

To install, download this directory and place all the .jar files inside your /mods directory
on your MC neoforge instance. The hidden .index directory is for Prism Launcher. If you do not use
Prism then you can safely delete these files, otherwise they are essential for the launcher listing
the installed mods.

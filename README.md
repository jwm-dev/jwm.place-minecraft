This github page will be maintained and attempt to keep parity with the jwm.place
minecraft server and is provided as an easy resource to download the collection of mods
used on the server. This server is a private entity whose members are invite-only, meaning
this page is not in violation of any "redistribution" clause contained within any particular license.

For versioning, each .jar file will indicate the proper version of the mod to download.

You can either download the ones here, which should be kept up-to-date with what is currently
running on the server, or you can seek out the individual modpages and download them from their source.

To install, download this directory and place all the .jar files inside your /mods directory
on your MC neoforge instance. The hidden .index directory is for Prism Launcher. If you do not use
Prism then you can safely delete these files, otherwise they are essential for the launcher listing
the installed mods.

\* Note that I am not sure if these mods are required to be installed on the client
if they are installed server-side. [to-do - look into this]

**If you would like the same client setup as jwm, merely download this directory and install
as previously directed.**
